Advent of Code 2017
===================

This is the C++ code I wrote for [Advent of Code 2017][AoC2017].

Some of the programs expect input on stdin, some may take the input filename
as a command-line parameter.

Disclaimer: These were written to solve the problem of the day, so do not
expect beautiful code.
